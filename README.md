## What is Paper Dots ?
Paper Dots is an automatic insights extraction tool from research papers, which 
* Automatically annotates a research paper PDF with important keyphrases, ensuring faster skim-reading of papers
* Builds cumulative Knowledge Graph on top of papers read so far, helping in tracking important concepts
* Delivers relevant papers continuously through mail, promoting consistent and directed learning

The end-to-end pipeline is shown below:
